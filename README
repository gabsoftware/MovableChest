MovableChest let Minecraft players move their Chests, Furnaces, Dispensers and Brewing stands with Pistons.
This is an alpha release, it probably contains bugs. I can't be taken for responsible of any damage to your Minecraft server and/or world.

Known problems:
* No piston sound while extending
* If pistons move too rapidly, the chest, furnace etc may disapear.
